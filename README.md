# knn

This is merely a simple app to demonstrate how to use KNN with Clojure.
There are no machine learning libraries or any of that hubub, just data and functions.

## Installation

Download the repo via git and run `lein run`.

## Options

Due to laziness and demonstration purposes, this app does not accept command line arguments. You can modify the existing source code and `let bindings` to allow you to run against different data.
